Strategies
==========

A Python library for control flow programming.

This project contains a set of complementary higher order functions that
loosely resembles the Stratego language.

History
-------

This project was inspired by the Stratego language for programmatic control in
the Stratego/XT project.  It was first implemented as part of the
[SymPy](http://sympy.org) Python library for symbolic algebra but was then spun
off as a separate project. 

Install
-------

The interface to this library are in flux.  Feedback is very welcome.  
Confidence in consistency is misplaced.

    sudo pip install strategies
