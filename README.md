Strategies
==========

A Python library for programming control flow.

This project contains a set of complementary higher order functions that
loosely resemble the Stratego[1] language.

History
-------

This project was inspired by the Stratego language for programmatic control in
the Stratego/XT project.  It was first implemented as part of the
[SymPy](http://sympy.org) Python library for symbolic algebra but was then spun
off as a separate project.
